\section{CONCLUSION}

As the relevance of supersonic aerospace applications is growing, the need for more data and analysis on
related phenomena in more complex and bigger problems are increasing. The presented work interfaces with the Femap NX NASTRAN,
a broadly diffused and accepted commercial FEA software in the aerospace industry, to enable a fast and flexible pre-processing and post-processing of supersonic panel flutter problems.
This software enables the quick setup of aerodynamic model on more complex structures and other kinds phenomena (e.g.,\ curved panels, aerothermoelasticity, aeroservoelasticity),
as also for reliable and \emph{industrial-ready} design and analysis
of skin, shells and plates structures.

The software can also be improved with little effort to support others aeroelastic theories and solution sequences available in NASTRAN (e.g.,\ strip theory, aeroelastic response, model sensibility and optimization).

The software may be made available given a reasonable request.
