	abstract = {A flow field modified local piston theory, which is applied to the integrated analysis on static/dynamic aeroelastic behaviors of curved panels, is proposed in this paper. The local flow field parameters used in the modification are obtained by CFD technique which has the advantage to simulate the steady flow field accurately. This flow field modified local piston theory for aerodynamic loading is applied to the analysis of static aeroelastic deformation and flutter stabilities of curved panels in hypersonic flow. In addition, comparisons are made between results obtained by using the present method and curvature modified method. It shows that when the curvature of the curved panel is relatively small, the static aeroelastic deformations and flutter stability boundaries obtained by these two methods have little difference, while for curved panels with larger curvatures, the static aeroelastic deformation obtained by the present method is larger and the flutter stability boundary is smaller compared with those obtained by the curvature modified method, and the discrepancy increases with the increasing of curvature of panels. Therefore, the existing curvature modified method is non-conservative compared to the proposed flow field modified method based on the consideration of hypersonic flight vehicle safety, and the proposed flow field modified local piston theory for curved panels enlarges the application range of piston theory.},

	abstract = {Piston theory may be used in the high Mach number supersonic flow region and/or in very high frequency subsonic or supersonic flow. In this flow model, the pressure at a point on the fluid-solid interface only depends on the downwash at the same point. However the classical piston theory may not be sufficient for some phenomena in aeroelasticity and aeroacoustics (far field prediction). Dowell and Bliss have created an extension of piston theory that allows for higher order effects that take into account the effect the distribution of downwash on pressure at any point. For simple harmonic motion, expansions in reduced frequency, inverse reduced frequency and/or inverse (square of) Mach number have all been created; The effects of higher order terms in these several expansion in creating an enhanced piston theory was illustrated for plunge and pitch motion of an airfoil (discrete system) by Ganji and Dowell. In the present paper, flutter prediction for a flexible panel in two –dimensional flow is investigated using enhanced piston theory. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate that an enhance version of piston theory can analyze single degree of freedom flutter of a panel as compared to the classical piston theory and quasi-steady aerodynamic models which can only treat coupled mode flutter.},

An implicit finite element formulation of the structural equations, as well as a Galerkin solution of the von Kármán plate equation are employed to solve elastic panel deformations with respect to geometric nonlinearities. A detailed validation process has shown good agreement with results from the literature for high subsonic and low supersonic Mach numbers. Thereby, a recent comparison between theory and experiment is confirmed. The validated solver is then used for further studies focusing on the impact of turbulent boundary layers on aeroelastic stability boundaries and instabilities. An increase in aerodynamic damping due to a viscous boundary layer is identified by an increase of the aeroelastic stability boundary. Furthermore, a significant damping on high flutter frequencies and mode shapes is revealed. The application of either a one-equation or two-equation turbulence model did not cause any major deviations in the results.},

Second, at 1{\textless}M≤1.67, single-mode flutter occurs in three distinct forms: limit cycle in the first mode (1{\textless}M{\textless}1.33 and 1.5{\textless}M≤1.67) or higher modes; limit cycle in the first and second modes being in internal 1:2 resonance (1.12{\textless}M{\textless}1.33 and 1.42{\textless}M{\textless}1.5); and non-periodic oscillations with several dominating frequencies being in more complex ratio (1.33{\textless}M{\textless}1.42).

In this situation, the use of a model reduction method is essential. However, the construction of a modal reduction basis for aeroviscoelastic systems is still a challenge, owing to the inherent frequency- and temperature-dependent behavior of the viscoelastic materials. Thus, the main contribution intended for the present study is to propose an efficient and accurate iterative enriched Ritz basis to deal with aeroviscoelastic systems.

	abstract = {Aircraft and spacecraft skin can undergo potentially destructive aeroelastic motions in high-speed flight. Reliable mathematical modelling is crucial for understanding such phenomena and aiding aerospace structural design. The panels of real skin structures are normally thin-walled elements riveted to beams and frames that act as stiffeners. In panel flutter literature, however, such stiffening components are normally idealised as perfectly immovable supports or, at best, as linear springs, which restricts the level of information to be obtained from the analyses. Aiming to better understand how the flexibility and mobility of stiffeners affect the aeroelastic behaviour of reinforced panels, the present work employs a more realistic model for skin structures. The Mindlin theory is used for the panel, and the stiffener is modelled as an eccentric Timoshenko beam. Geometrical non-linearity is added to both models, and the supersonic aerodynamic loads are calculated via linear piston theory. The Finite Element Method is employed for spatial discretisation, and an iterative Newmark-type scheme is used for time marching. Differently from what is typically done in the literature, the results are discussed not only from the standpoint of oscillation amplitudes, but also using energy distribution assessment. Solutions have been generated for several flow conditions and stiffener cross-sections. Comparison between the present results and those from a structurally-idealised model has demonstrated that modelling stiffeners as immovable boundaries overestimates flutter onset conditions and underestimates post-flutter amplitudes, thus being an unconservative simplification. Energy distribution analysis has shown that, for reasonably flexible stiffeners, the aeroelastic system can bifurcate and move between two stable limit cycles, one of which displays larger energy levels. Furthermore, it has been shown that the total energy can be unevenly distributed along the structure during flutter, which can be used to determine suitable locations for control devices or energy sinks.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the geometrical nonlinear flutter of cross-ply laminated shallow shell with rectangular boundary and strong nonlinearity. The classical laminate plate and piston aerodynamic theories are employed to obtain the governing equation of the systems. The Galerkin method and approximate-analytical homotopy perturbation method are used to predict the flutter boundary of the laminated shallow shell. In this study, the effects of shell geometric dimensions, stacking sequence, and initial deflection on critical flutter pressure are investigated. According to the results, the initial deflection and stacking sequence of the laminated shells can change the nonlinear behavior of shells. The method presented in this study is more accurate than usual perturbation methods in predicting the nondimensional flutter pressure of laminated shallow shell subjected to large initial deflections.},
